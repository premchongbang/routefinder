session

//creating session
app.use(session({
	reserve: false,
	saveUninitialized: true,
	secret: credentials.cookieSecret,
}));

// middleware to count the number of views for specific page
app.use(function(req, res, next){
var views = req.session.views:

if(!views){
	views = req.session.views ={};
}
// gets the pathname
var pathname = parseurl(reg).pathname;
views[pathname] = (views[pathname] || 0) + 1;
next();
});
